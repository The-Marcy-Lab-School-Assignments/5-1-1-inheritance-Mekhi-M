# Question

What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

# Answer

An instance method can be used by a an instance of a class. They typically use data inside of the instance and as such are used after an instance is created on a class.

Class methods are created using the `static` keyword and can only be used on the class itself. They typically use data also relegated to the class specifically using the `static` keyword or hard-coded data. They can be used at any time after the class has been created as they use data that is not tied to a specific instance of the class.
