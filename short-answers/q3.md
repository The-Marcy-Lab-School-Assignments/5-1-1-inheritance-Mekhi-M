# Question

What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer

Polymorphism is when you "overwrite" an existing property/method by using the same name of that property/method, but assigning it a different value/function. When you invoke a method that was defined through inheritance, but is also defined in the current class's definition, the invocation will adhere to the definition in the current class. This is because an invocation will look through the current class's definition for a method matching the invocation first, moving one step up the prototype chain only if a match has not been found.

Example:

```js
class Bicycle {
  constructor(color) {
    this.color = color;
    this.numOfWheels = 2;
  }

  ride() {
    console.log("Cycling all around town!");
  }

  logRidingDifficulty() {
    console.log(`Number of wheels: ${this.numOfWheels} | 
        This bicycle is easy to ride with a little bit of practice! You must learn how to balance yourself as you ride.`);
  }
}

class Tricycle extends Bicycle {
  constructor(color) {
    super(color);
    this.numOfWheels = 3;
  }

  logRidingDifficulty() {
    console.log(`Number of wheels: ${this.numOfWheels} | 
        This tricycle is easy to ride from the start! The third wheel will take away the requirement to balance yourself.`);
  }
}
```
